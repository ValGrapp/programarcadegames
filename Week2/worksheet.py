# Give an example of a binary number. (While a number such as ``1'' can be a binary, decimal, and hexadecimal number,
# try coming up with an example that better illustrates the differences between the different bases of numbers.)
# Solution: 1010 0010 0011 --> only 0 and 1s


# Give an example of a decimal number.
# Solution: 18 --> numbers 0 to 9


# Give an example of a hexadecimal number.
# Solution: 8F --> 0-9 and A-F


# Convert the numbers 1, 10, 100, 1000, and 10000 from binary to decimal.
# Solution:           1,  2,   4,    8,        16


# What is a compiler?
# Solution: Converts source code to machine code


# What is source code?
# Solution: The program the developer types into the computer


# What is machine language? (Don't just say binary. That's not correct.)
# Solution: The native code the computer runs


# What is a first generation language? (Don't just say binary. That's not correct.)
# Solution: Machine language


# What is a second generation language?
# Solution: Assembly language


# What is a third generation language? (Explain, don't just give one example.)
# Solution: Language like Python or C that has logical structures and also for specific purposes


# What is an interpreter and how does it differ from a compiler?
# Solution: Runs source code directly, without compiling


# Search the web and find some of the most popular programming languages.
# List the website(s) you got the information from and what the languages are.
# Solution: JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, Swift, TypeScript, Go, SQL, Ruby, R

# Look at the job boards and see what languages people are looking for.
# List the languages and the job board you looked at.
# Solution: Python, Java, Javascript (Frontend)


# What is the difference between the ``syntax'' and ``semantics'' of a language?
# Solution: Semantics follow directly from syntax. Syntax refers to the structure/form of
# the code that a specific programming language specifies but Semantics deal with the meaning
# assigned to the symbols, characters and words.


# Pick a piece of technology, other than a computer you use regularly.
# Briefly describe the hardware and software that run on it.
# Solution: iPhone: iOS made with Swift
